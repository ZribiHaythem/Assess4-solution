# Week 04 Assessment

## Guidelines

Assessments are meant to give you and RBK staff an idea of how well you understand, or can figure out, the material that you covered recently.

- Turn off all communication devices such as your phone, email, Slack, etc.
- Fork this repo and clone down your fork to your laptop/Mac machines.
- Commit **working** code early and often (at least after every prompt). You are graded on your commit messages in addition to the code that you write.

-describe your intent. **Leaving a prompt blank is tantamount to failing a prompt. You'll get much more credit even for writing comments or pseudo-code that describe your intent**

- You **must** submit a pull request for all assessments **on time** (guidelines for how to submit a pull request are below). Give yourself several minutes to do this at the end of the time allotted for the assessment

- After completing the assessment, if there are any prompts you felt you did not do well on, or, that you would not know how to assess whether or not you did well on, make plans to improve your skills on that topic **as soon as possible.**

## Using and Referencing Outside Resources

you can't copy and past from the internet , and you can't look at your previous code, You have only one Available resource which is MDN.

## Submitting Solutions

Solutions are submitted via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Follow these steps:

1. From **your fork**, select `Pull Requests` and then create a `New pull request`.
2. STOP. _Before_ you `Click to create a pull request for this comparison` you must **adjust the target branch** (aka `base branch`) to be your username. Once chagned, the pull-request heading should look like this:

> rbk:username ... username:master

3. Click `Send pull request`

**NOTE: Only submit one pull request per assessment.** You can feel free to continue working on the content and can submit another PR after our incredible Instruction Team has completed reviewing your work (which takes about a week), but submitting multiple PRs greatly complicates our review process and subverts our ability to observe your work in the context of specific time constraints.
